# I'm bet,

Learning **web security** and focusing on **bug bounty hunting**.  
Currently exploring vulnerabilities like SQLi, XSS, SSRF, and more.  

On the side, I sometimes dive into:
- 🐍 Python and Bash scripting
- 🧩 Algorithm problems (LeetCode, etc.)

## 🚀 Current Focus
- Practicing web vulnerabilities (labs & write-ups)
- Trying to ditch Windows and live on Linux 🐧 
- Building a personal knowledge repo: [Web Vulnerability Journal](https://github.com/bbetulkaya/web-vuln-journal)


<!-- ## 🛠️ Tech & Tools
- Burp Suite, sqlmap,
- Python
-->

## 🌱 Goals
- Improve bug bounty skills step by step
- Share write-ups and payloads
- Level up in Python & problem-solving
