# I'm betul,

Exploring **reverse engineering** and working toward becoming a reverse engineer.  
Currently learning **C and Python** and enjoying breaking down programs to understand how they really work.

On the side, I love experimenting with:
- 🎨 Creating pixel art using Aseprite
- 🧩 Building cute desktop applications

## 🚀 Current Focus
- Learning Python with **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python**
- Learning C with **The C Programming Language K&R**
- Making pixel art and small desktop app
- Writing Medium posts to share what I learn and document my journey

## 🌱 Goals
- Understand software deeply by analysing and experimenting with programs
- Improve C, Python and problem-solving skills
- Keep creating software projects and pixel art
